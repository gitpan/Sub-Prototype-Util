NAME
    Sub::Prototype::Util - Prototype-related utility routines.

VERSION
    Version 0.05

SYNOPSIS
        use Sub::Prototype::Util qw/flatten recall/;

        my @a = qw/a b c/;
        my @args = ( \@a, 1, { d => 2 }, undef, 3 );

        my @flat = flatten '\@$;$', @args; # ('a', 'b', 'c', 1, { d => 2 })
        recall 'CORE::push', @args; # @a contains 'a', 'b', 'c', 1, { d => 2 }, undef, 3

DESCRIPTION
    Prototypes are evil, but sometimes you just have to bear with them,
    especially when messing with core functions. This module provides
    several utilities aimed at facilitating "overloading" of prototyped
    functions.

    They all handle 5.10's "_" prototype.

FUNCTIONS
  "flatten $proto, @args"
    Flattens the array @args according to the prototype $proto. When @args
    is what @_ is after calling a subroutine with prototype $proto,
    "flatten" returns the list of what @_ would have been if there were no
    prototype.

  "recall $name, @args"
    Calls the function $name with the prototyped argument list @args. That
    is, @args should be what @_ is when you define a subroutine with the
    same prototype as $name. For example,

        my $a = [ ];
        recall 'CORE::push', $a, 1, 2, 3;

    will call "push @$a, 1, 2, 3" and so fill the arrayref $a with "1, 2,
    3". This is especially needed for core functions because you can't
    "goto" into them.

    You can also force the use of a specific prototype. In this case, $name
    must be a hash reference that holds exactly one key/value pair, the key
    being the function name and the value the prototpye that should be used
    to call it.

        recall { 'CORE::push' => '\@$' }, $a, 1, 2, 3; # will only push 1

    This allows you to recall into "CORE::grep" and "CORE::map" by using the
    "\&@" prototype :

        sub mygrep (&@) { recall { 'CORE::grep' => '\&@' }, @_ } # the prototypes are intentionally different

EXPORT
    The functions "flatten" and "recall" are only exported on request,
    either by providing their name or by the ':funcs' and ':all' tags.

DEPENDENCIES
    Carp, Exporter (core modules since perl 5), Scalar::Util (since 5.7.3).
